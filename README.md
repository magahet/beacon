BEACON
=======

Beacon is a work in progress and is not feature complete.

This is a simple webapp to log the position of individuals with an appropriate smartphone app, and allow users to write notification rules to alert them on changes in position, speed, etc.

An example use case is to notify user A when user B leaves the office for the day.
